# Histogram Equalization and Enhancement Techniques

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the implementation and analysis of various histogram equalization techniques to improve image contrast. The primary objectives include implementing the basic Histogram Equalization (HE) algorithm, exploring its pros and cons, and developing and evaluating advanced versions like Adaptive Histogram Equalization (AHE) and Contrast-Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE).
